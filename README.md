# Project-4 CapStone 

# Instructions: 
This is an app that will help refugees, locals of an area and mono lingual tourists. How might you ask? It will help understand the languages and cultures of new places one may visit or live at. So tourists and locals may communicate and become a part of the community in a faster and organized way. Trade and cultural exchange is what the world needs to thrive as one whole entity and this is what my apps creation was based on. One World One Family.
